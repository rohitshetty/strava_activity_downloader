# Strava Activity Downloader

## What does this solve?

I want to sync my Strava activities to my blog (Which is made with Hugo). I want a cli tool that can list the activities, download the latest/selected activity, and download the gpx file, and metadata.

Following the unix way of doing things, I wanted this to be a standalone CLI tool instead of being part of blog's scripts/ folder.

Pretty sure there are several different tools that does this job already - but I want to build one to learn rust. Rust has been on my radar for a while to learn - so why not jump headfirst into this?

## Building

`make build`
